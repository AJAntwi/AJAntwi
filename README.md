I'm Augustine, a recent graduate from Seneca College (Cloud Architecture & Administration, Class of 2024) with a background in business. My journey into tech has been exciting and enriching, and I am passionate about cloud technologies, IT support, and cybersecurity.

Currently, I am focused on learning Python and deepening my expertise in cloud platforms. I am actively seeking entry-level opportunities in IT Help Desk, Cloud Engineering, and Cybersecurity Analyst roles. While I have not yet worked on any major projects, I am eager to gain hands-on experience, collaborate, and grow within the tech community.
